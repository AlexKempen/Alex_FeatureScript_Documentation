The Plate FeatureScript can be found here: `Plate document <https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2c2b49357f3f1a232881256a/w/6258e1943ecedc8606542dd7/e/cc068eee4ec855a2eca0b059>`_

.. warning::
    The latest version of the Plate FeatureScript is still experimental. Thus, there are a few known issues and other bugs associated with it, and it may behave improperly in certain situations.

..Steps for creating plates from sketch geometry
    ----------------------------------------------

    #. In the **Plate** tab:

        #. Define the outside of the plate by selecting **Outer geometery** in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion.

            There are several types of geometry which can be selected:

            * Points
            * Lines
            * Arcs
            * Circles

            As you click geoemetry, lines will automatically be generated between selections, provided that the selections are not touching.

            After selecting an arc or line, a flip manipulator will be generated in the :term:`graphics window<Graphics window>` which allows you to flip the sides the automatically generated lines connect to the boundary.

            Notably, the default behavior of connecting a point is automatically altered by adding a hole to the point in the **Hole** tab. This converts the point into an outer geometry hole, and causes the outer boundary of the plate to be automatically redrawn to honor the specified wall thickness of the plate.

    #. In the **Hole** tab:

    #. In the **Finish** tab:

        #. If desired, choose **Boolean plate** and then specify a part boolean operation (**Add**, **Remove**, or **Intersect**) and select a **Merge scope** (or choose **Merge with all**) to boolean the plate to existing parts in the part studio.

    Steps for adding outer geometry to an existing plate
    ----------------------------------------------------

    When a plate is created using the **Outer geometry** option, point manipulators are automatically added to each autogenerated line connecting the boundary of the plate.

    Normally, when a plate is being defined, queries are selected in a clockwise or counter-clockwise order. To add additional entities out of order, the following procedure can be followed:

    #. In the **Plate** tab:

        #. Select the point manipulator of the autogenerated line you'd like to break to make room for your next selection.
        #. Select your next piece of geometry. The selected autogenerated line is broken to make room. 

    Steps for creating plates from faces
    ------------------------------------
    #. In the **Plate** tab:

    #. In the **Hole** tab:

        #. Add one or more holes to the plate by choosing **Add hole**, specifying your hole, and then selecting one or more vertices to use

    #. In the **Finish** tab:
